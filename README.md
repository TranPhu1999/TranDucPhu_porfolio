## "I, a universe of atoms, an atom in the universe" Richard Feynman

When I was young, I sometimes look into the sky and ask myself. As a speck of dust in this vast universe, will my existence have any meaning? Will my action can make any change in this world? After a long time of self-exploring, self-explanation, reading, and listening, I think I have found some answers to those questions. Throughout history, humans have changed the course of nature by using 2 things: the ability to work together and the ability to use tools. And that is what I believe. By working together with other people as a Company and with the right tool, which is Data in our era, I will be on the right path to change myself and change a small part of this world.
