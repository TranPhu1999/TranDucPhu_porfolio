    <p>Hi, I'm Tran Duc Phu, a Graduated Student of the Ho Chi Minh University of Science majoring in computer science. I may have very little working experience in this industry, just about 1.5 years but I'm always curious and eager to learn new things. Especially in the field of data analysis and data science. I'm fascinated with all the things that we can do when we have those data in our hands.<br>Like Albert Einstein used to say "I am neither clever nor especially gifted. I'm just very, very curious"</p>

# Project: [YOLO_face_mask_detection](https://github.com/TranPhu1999/YOLO_face_mask_detection)
In this project: Tensorflow, OpenCV, Numpy, flask, HTML, CSS, JavaSript
- Train a Yolov3 model to detect Face mask wearing with Kaggle Face Mask Dataset
- Build a Flask API that receive image send it to one of the two Yolov3 models (first one is pretrained model on COCO dataset, the second one is the model that I just train above) as input and send image result to a web interface 
- Build a simple web interface that Upload image from user then send it to Flask API, receive and display the output
