                <p>Hi, I'm Tran Duc Phu, a graduate student at the Ho Chi Minh University of Science majoring in computer science. With just 3 years of experience, I know I must always stay humble because there are still so many things to learn. What I'm looking for right now is a chance to bring value to AI-driven businesses or if convenient, a friend, a mentor, a good chance to learn and experience new things, especially in the field of data analysis and data science. </p>
